  "description": "<div>\n<strong>A Paralympic skiier from Mexico isn\u2019t something you expect to see too often. But Arly Velasquez doesn\u2019t believe in expectations. </strong><br />\n<br />\nVelasquez, one of a select few to ever represent Mexico at a Winter Paralympic Games, discusses the role of risk in his life - and how we can all learn to manage it.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI have developed because of taking decisions where I have no idea. It\u2019s a matter of 'does it feel right or not?'\" he said.<br />\n<br />\n\"I don't see it as a risk, I see that when I am in the mountain on a sit ski, I just feel the most free.\u201d\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThe former BMX champion also discusses the risks he took when leaving Mexico on the spur of a moment, building a new life on the ski slopes in Canada. \u00a0<br />\n<br />\n\u201c(Skiing) gave me the belief to go back to Mexico, sell all my stuff,\u00a0 sell my car and pretty much fly to the border,\" he said.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n\"It's very, rare that there are moments in your life where you are feeling and your gut tells you that you are in the right place. That you are doing the right thing and that it's something that you want to keep doing in your life. That's what I felt for the first time.\u201d\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nLearning topics for this episode include managing risk, how to build a brand, self-understanding, defiance, thrill-seeking and exploration. \u00a0<br />\n<br />\nAllianz is a long-standing partner of the International Paralympic Committee. Together, we\u2019re proud to bring you A Winning Mindset: Lessons From The Paralympics. We aim to help you move forward in all aspects of your personal and professional life.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nBy hearing from Paralympic stars, you\u2019ll be introduced to stories that inspire and change the way you think. Stories of facing life\u2019s challenges with confidence, determination and excellence, and the true power of having the right team behind you.\u00a0</div>",
